## Brief Bio

I do research on scalable methods for machine learning, with a focus on generative models. My contributions include the [Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) (VAE), the [Adam optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980), [Glow](https://openai.com/blog/glow), and [Variational Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00630), but please see [Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=yyIoQu4AAAAJ) for a more complete list. I obtained a PhD (cum laude) from University of Amsterdam in 2017 and was part of the founding team of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) in 2015. Before that, I co-founded Advanza which got acquired in 2016. My formal name is Diederik, but have the Frysian nickname Durk (pronounced like Dirk). I currently live in the San Francisco Bay area.

- 2018 - Present: Research Scientist at Google Brain / DeepMind. I work on SOTA generative models for text, image, and video.
- 2015 - 2018: Part of [founding team](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) and Research Scientist at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) (San Francisco). Lead of the Algorithms team, focused on basic research.
- 2013 - 2017: Ph.D. (cum laude) at University of Amsterdam, advised by Max Welling, on the topic of deep learning and generative models. Thesis: [Variational Inference and Deep Learning: A New Synthesis](https://twitter.com/dpkingma/status/914277278602821633?lang=en). Spent summers of 2014/2015 at DeepMind for collaborations.
- 2010 - 2012: Co-founder and technical lead at [Advanza](https://www.advanza.nl/), successful exit in 2016.
- 2009 and 2012: Jr. Research Scientist at New York University, Yann LeCun's lab.
